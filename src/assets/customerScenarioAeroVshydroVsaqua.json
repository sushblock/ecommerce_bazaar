        "reasoning": [
          "Aeroponics uses minimal water compared to hydroponics or aquaponics, making it suitable for water-scarce regions.",
          "The fine mist in aeroponics systems allows efficient nutrient absorption by plants, reducing water wastage.",
          "In this arid region, the need for fish farming (as in aquaponics) may not be as pressing, making aeroponics a more resource-efficient choice."
