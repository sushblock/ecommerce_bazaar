          "Water Temperature: Pomfret and rohu are tropical freshwater fish species. They thrive in water temperatures typically between 25°C to 32°C. Ensure that the water temperature in your aquaponics system remains within this range.",
          "Tank Size: Both pomfret and rohu can grow to a significant size. You'll need appropriately sized fish tanks to accommodate their growth. The size of the tank should be proportional to the number of fish you intend to raise.",
          "Water Quality: These fish are sensitive to water quality parameters such as ammonia, nitrites, and pH. Aquaponics systems naturally filter and treat water, but it's essential to monitor and maintain water quality parameters to ensure the health and growth of the fish.",
          "Fish Stocking Density: Consider the recommended stocking density for each fish species. Overcrowding can lead to stress and disease among the fish.",
          "Feeding: Pomfret and rohu are omnivorous and require a balanced diet. You may need to supplement their diet with commercial fish feed to ensure they receive adequate nutrition.",
          "Compatibility with Plant Growth: Remember that the fish in your aquaponics system provide nutrients for plant growth through their waste. Ensure that the fish species you choose are compatible with the plants you plan to grow. Some fish species may produce waste with different nutrient ratios, which could impact plant health.",
          "Local Regulations: Check local regulations and permits for raising these fish species, especially if you plan to sell them commercially.",
          "It's essential to conduct thorough research and consider the specific needs and conditions for raising pomfret and rohu in your aquaponics system. Consulting with aquaculture experts and local fisheries authorities can provide valuable insights and guidance for successfully integrating these fish species into your aquaponics farm. Additionally, starting with a smaller-scale aquaponics system before expanding can help you gain experience and fine-tune your methods."
