      "<p> When investors buys plans from Vidhavani, there is a time duration of 2-3 months after which enough corpus is built which can be used to buy large real assets like farms, orchards, lands to build parks/mud walks/nature walks within cities or nearby.</p><p>Company splits the corpus in two parts - around 20-30% in equity/option funds to generate better/faster returns and remaining in real assets to mitigtae risks alltogether. <br /><br /><b>These all will be the sources of income generation:</b> <br />1. Equity investment is through propritery algorithms which buys and sells equity/options and can potentially generate 15-20% annually.<br />2. Real assets will be fully utilized, for e.g. visits from public, produce selling, monthly subscriptions, etc. This can annually generate 4-5% of the returns.<br />3. The appreciation of assets which can be 20-30% annually.</p>",

    buttonText: "Secondary Asset Allocation Example",
    content:
      "<p>Vidhavani utilize corpus built in buying real physical assets like farms, orchards, jogging areas, and public parks as alternative assets, giving investor dual option. Investors are allocated a percentage of the asset corresponding to their percentage investment against asset value.</p><p>For example, best scenario case, if a user buys a Rs 50,000 investment plan for 5 years, which is at a 16% compounding rate, an asset worth Rs 10Cr purchased by the company will have a 0.04% allocation to the user. If the asset value grows to Rs 30Cr after 5 years, the investor's asset value grows to Rs 120,000, resulting in a 140% profit.But user primary investment grows to Rs 105,017.08, which is 110% profit. The investor can choose to withdraw Rs 105,017.08 after 5 years or remain invested with the asset which has given the investor 140% profit so far and have the potential to grow further. When investor decides to withdraw, the asset allocation is removed and the investor is paid the value of the asset.</p><p>In worst scenario case, if returns on secondary allocation is lesser than the primary, then investor can decide between withdrawing primary investment with interest or opt to continue with secondary, presuming the asset value will grow in future.</p>",

    buttonText: "Loan Option",
    content:
      "<p>Withdraw 50% of principal amount at a nominal interest rate for plans exceeding 1 year. In this scenario user plan will resume back once he has paid back the loan amount. This instrument is to give flexibility to the investor in case of emergency.</p><p>For e.g., if a user buys a Rs 50,000 investment plan for 5 years, at 13th month he takes loan of Rs 25,000 and repays after 8 months. So his investment plan will resume at 21st month on top of his 12 months intial completion. This means, his plan will mature after 5 years and 8 months.</p>",
